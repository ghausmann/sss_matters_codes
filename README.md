# sss_matters_codes
In this repository you will find the replication files from the paper "Approximating around the stochastic steady state matters: rethinking uncertainty shocks in small open economies", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 2026).

The current version only uses the solution package by Levintal (2017), and is missing replication files for the "SSS rec" solution, the Uzawa version of the model, and the solution with Taylor Projection, but I will update the repository soon. 

All the codes were tested with MATLAB R2021a and R2022b (the latest MATLAB versions may not work).

Most folders come with a readme ".txt" file that lists the codes with a brief description and provides instructions.

The subfolder "Perturbation" consists of the solution package by Levintal (2017), which comes with its own license.


Please write to guillermo.hausmann@evaf.vu.lt if you find any issue.

You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the sources!

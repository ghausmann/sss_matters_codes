# sss_matters_codes
In this repository you will find the replication files from the paper "Approximating around the stochastic steady state matters: rethinking uncertainty shocks in small open economies", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 2026).

The main DSGE toolbox used to produce the results is the solution package by Levintal (2017, JEDC), but the repository also includes files to replicate some key impulse responses using Dynare (version 5.X only). 

All the codes were tested with MATLAB R2021a and R2022b (the latest MATLAB versions may not work).

Most folders come with a readme ".txt" file that provides instructions and lists the codes with a brief description of what they do.

The subfolder "Perturbation" (in the folder "sss_matters_methods") and "solution methods" (in the folder "taylor projection codes") consists of toolboxes prepared by Oren Levintal, and they come with their own licenses. Make sure you cite his work properly if you plan to use them.

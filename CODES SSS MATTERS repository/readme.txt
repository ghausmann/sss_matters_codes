Brief description of each folder in this repository:

- estimated parameters: contains matlab .mat files
- sss_matters_methods: all functions and toolboxes used to replicate results

- model pac dss: script to do pre-processing of the plain FGRU model, to be executed just once
- model pac loc: script to do pre-processing of the auxiliary perturbation model to approximate around the SSS ("SSS fixed" solutions), to be executed just once
- model pac sss: script to do pre-processing of the auxiliary perturbation model to approximate around the SSS (SSS solutions), to be executed just once

- one_pp pac dss: scripts to replicate results from standard perturbation around DSS
- two_pp pac loc: scripts to replicate results from two-parameter perturbation around SSS ("SSS fixed" solutions)
- two_pp pac sss: scripts to replicate results from two-parameter perturbation around SSS (SSS solutions)

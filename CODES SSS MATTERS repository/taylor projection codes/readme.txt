In this folder (and subfolders) you'll find the Matlab codes to replicate the results from Taylor projection (Levintal, IER 2018).

Here's a description of the content (excluding this readme file):

- Folder "fgru pac tp loc": codes to replicate solutions using the DSS calibration (Table 3 and figures 6 and 7)
- Folder "fgru pac tp sss": codes to replicate solutions using the SSS calibration (Table 3 and figures 6 and 7)
- Folder "model pac": script "prepare_model_fgru_pac_tp" which does the pre-processing of the model
- Folder "solution methods": Levintal's toolboxes.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Add the parent folder of this repository 'CODES SSS MATTERS repository' to the Matlab path (folder only).
- Make sure you have run the script "prepare_model_fgru_pac_tp" at least once (make sure the folder is the main MATLAB path when executing)
